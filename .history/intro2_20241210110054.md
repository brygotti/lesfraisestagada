        <h1>A Story About Biases</h1>
        <p>
            Today, content on the internet is still mostly produced by Western societies 
            <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Decolonizing_Wikipedia.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a>
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/internet-white-western-google-wikipedia-skewed#:~:text=of%20the%20world.-,For%20the%20first%20time%20in%20history%2C%20we%20are%20creating%20a,skewed%20towards%20rich%2C%20western%20countries." target="_blank">[2]</a>. 
            Interestingly, those same societies also produce most of the human knowledge, which we proxy as the number of citable publications 
            <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?year=2007&order=it&ord=desc#google_vignette" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/" target="_blank">Wikispeedia</a> is an online game built on 4604 Wikipedia articles from 2007 during which players are navigating from a given start to a target end article through the links contained in the articles.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project we intend to investigate playersâ€™ behaviors and their biases. More precisely, we ask if the way players play Wikispeedia is dependent on how knowledge is produced in the world? Or are they influenced by the Wikipedia graph, which is itself biased towards countries that produce the most knowledge?
