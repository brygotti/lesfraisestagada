# Anatomy of the data

# Country assignment 
We started by using a naive approach by doing a text search and finding all the country string names inside the plaintext. The results were then parsed in a table containing as index the article name and as columns all the possible countries on earth along with the number of occurrences in the specific article. After this the top 2 countries per article were kept. This approach resulted in 1412 articles having no country assigned to them. By going manually through them we saw that with human intuition, some articles can be further classified to countries even if the country name is not explicitly mentioned in the text.

Then talk about LLMs (latest work)

# Assessment of article connectivity
Articles do not exist alone in Wikipedia. Indeed, they are all, to a certain extent, connected to each other through the links that they contain. To assess an article’s connectivity we calculated the number of links that lead in and out of it, respectively referred to as *num_links_in* and *num_links_out*. To find the number of links out of an article we simply counted the number of links contained in that article (24 in the example below). To find to number of links that lead into an article, we counted the number of times that article occurs in other articles (for example, North America appears in the example article below so this makes +1 to the *num_links_in count* of the North America article). 


# Quantification of players’ behavior
To quantify the player’s behavior in the Wikispeedia game, we are interested in the way they *use* articles, meaning that we want to see if some articles are more *used in the process of retrieving a target article from a source article. To quantify the usage of an article, we utilize the number of times an article is clicked (referred to as click count in our work). To calculate the click count per article we count the number of occurrences of an article in both finished and unfinished paths. 

$$Click Count_{article} = \sum_{p=1}^{P} Occurrences_{article, p}$$

As a reminder, a path corresponds to the sequence of articles that a player clicks in order to go from a given source article to a set target article. With our click count metric we can proxy article usage quite accurately. The higher the click count of an article, the more players used it and the bigger is the importance of this article (which importance does this correspond to? This we will find out!).
